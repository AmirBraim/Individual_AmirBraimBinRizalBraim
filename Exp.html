            <h1>My Experience</h1>
           
            <p>My experience throughout my studies is while I was in semester 3, I was a member of the Informa UiTM Kedah academic representative committee, which meant that my concentration was only on students in the Faculty of Information Management. However, in semester 4, I was elected as a student representative council at UiTM Kedah, which prompted me to devote more time to student welfare. It was a very good experience for me in UiTM Kedah

			For my studies, my calendar was jam-packed, and I wanted to ensure that I could balanced my academics with my responsibilities to student welfare. As a member of the student representative council at UiTM Kedah, I was required to attend several meetings with the head of UiTM Kedah as well as the academic club, which forced me to missed my online lessons. This requires me to catch up on all of my courses with my pals in order to get information about the online class. Sometimes I need to record an online lecture in-order-to remember all of the main points and explanations for the particular subjects. From this experienced, I learned to managed my time properly in order to make sure I succeed in both commitment. Having a responsibility as a son to achieved my parents dream to passed with flying colour and at the same time to be a good leader is not an easy burden for me but I managed to do it until now. As the saying goes “A good leader is where a person could balanced between the commitment he have”.</p>
