		<center><p style="background-color:palegreen;">Family history is very important to an individual. By knowing where you come from, you can have a better perspective of your life. Having a clear understanding of your family background allows you to better appreciate the things that you would normally take for granted. This is my Family, which known as Braim’s Family. I have been brought-up in a very discipline atmosphere where values and principles have always been given priority. It gives me great pleasure to give introduction of my family. My respected father name is Mr. Rizal Braim. He is an business man. My mother, Anarozani is a house wife. In spit-of being a very family lady. She has been a great source of motivation in my life. A part from this I have 5 siblings which is Rizana Braim (Older Sister), Andry Braim (Brother), Maisara Braim (Younger sister), Danish Braim and Faris Braim (Younger Brother) They all are loving and supporting in nature.  All of my siblings have the Braim name including all of my cousin and currently it has 52 braim’s </p></center>
