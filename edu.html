This course has taught me to be an independent and a successful person in the future. I never thought that I managed to continued my diploma studies in this field but I nailed it. Online classes is not easy as what people see because it is more challenging and it played with our mental where students need to changed their study method from physically to online learning. Without moral supports from both of my parents and lectures that guided me till now, I could not imagined what I have been achieved today. I hope that this pandemic could end as soon as the possible because I want to have a normal student life where we as a students able to attend the physical class and also join various activity  in the university so that I could create good memories with my friend my study journey. </p></center>
